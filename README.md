# 🤖 AI-Powered Personal Chatbot

This project is a fully functional, AI-powered personal assistant built using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Streamlit**. The chatbot is capable of maintaining conversation history, providing context-aware responses, and is designed to be **modular and extensible** for future enhancements.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **Conversational Memory**: Remembers and references past messages for coherent and relevant replies.
* 🔁 **LangGraph-Powered Flow**: Efficiently manages complex multi-step conversations using graph-based logic.
* 🖥️ **Streamlit Frontend**: Clean, interactive UI for seamless real-time chat experiences.
* 🔄 **Modular Architecture**: Easily swap out the LLM (e.g., OpenAI) with other providers.
* 🛠️ **Customizable**: Add new tools, memory types, or agent capabilities as needed.
